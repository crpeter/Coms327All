1. Started project.

2. Got a empty board with borders to print in terminal.

3. Fixed a bug where printing rooms onto the board caused '.' Chars to appear everywhere by switching the order I used variable indices in a nested for-loop.

4. Terminal now prints game board and 5 rooms. Random number generator is using the same values eveytime.

5. Created a pseudo random range method and added a seed value to stand to get some good rand rands.

6. Board now generates very randomly.

7. Added methods tunnelSide() to add horizontal hallways and tunnelUp() to add hallway up and down. Also, added method addHallways() which adds a hallway between each room and a reference point somewhere on the board. Board now generates a at least 5 rooms and hallways that connect every room.
