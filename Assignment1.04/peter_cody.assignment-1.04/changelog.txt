1. Started project.

2. Got a empty board with borders to print in terminal.

3. Fixed a bug where printing rooms onto the board caused '.' Chars to appear everywhere by switching the order I used variable indices in a nested for-loop.

4. Terminal now prints game board and 5 rooms. Random number generator is using the same values eveytime.

5. Created a pseudo random range method and added a seed value to stand to get some good rand rands.

6. Board now generates very randomly.

7. Added methods tunnelSide() to add horizontal hallways and tunnelUp() to add hallway up and down. Also, added method addHallways() which adds a hallway between each room and a reference point somewhere on the board. Board now generates a at least 5 rooms and hallways that connect every room.

8. Started loading and saving files

9. Fixed a bug where I couldn't open a file (or run the program at all) by switching to pyrite because Mac OS doesn't let you use endian.h.

10. Switched an x and y value when loading a file to a board that caused the rooms to be in incorrect position.

11.Decided to save the board as a 2d array of structs so as to keep track of density of tile and char that represents it.

12. Fixed a bug in tunnel up method that did't set the density of tile it was tunneling through, only the char.

13. Changed the byte count at the last step of reading a file because it was 1 off and messing with the board. 

14. Change board tile struct to include distance to player for non tunneling and tunneling npc.

15. Fixed a bug where I was naming tile differently in header file than implementation.

16. Switched an I and j somewhere and took an hour to find it.

17. Tried printing and was stuck for a long time; figured out that because I need to print spaces for the non tunneling monster distances, had to use printf with %c. This entailed using number to represent a char in ascii table. Luckily the char for 0-9 are in a range between 48 and 57. Every time the distance goes up by 10 I subtract 10 and if the distance is greater than the possible max distance then print a space.

18. Tried quite a few different values because I didn't understand the dijikstra pseudocode on wikipedia but eventually got the right variables in the right places. The backwards pointing arrows really through me off.

19. Added functionality to make player move around randomly.

20. Added to types of mon, p for human (tunneling) and P for giant (non tunneling).

21. Fixed what seemed like more bugs than one man can eat I made it so the giant follows the best gradient to the player inside the rooms and hallways. Also made it so the human follows the best gradient regardless of hallways.

22. Implemented the priority queue with a comparator that is based on the speed of a mon_struct. For some reason taking the min will never give you the player after the initial remove min. Wasn't able to solve this.
